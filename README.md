# The Project contains two parts:
## PART A - IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining whether a given text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. In this project, I analyzed movie reviews from the IMDb dataset and predict the sentiment (positive or negative) based on the text of the reviews. By leveraging various text preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and classification algorithms, this project will develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the sentiment of movie reviews. The insights derived from this analysis can be useful for movie producers, critics, and platforms like IMDb to understand public opinion and tailor marketing or content strategies accordingly.

## PART B - News Article Classification
In todayâ€™s digital world, news articles are constantly being generated and shared across different platforms. For news organizations, social media platforms, and aggregators, classifying articles into specific categories such as sports, politics, and technology can help improve content management and recommendation systems. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify news articles into predefined categories, such as sports, politics, and technology, based on their content.
By automating this process, organizations can efficiently categorize large volumes of news articles, making it easier for readers to access relevant information based on their interests.
